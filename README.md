A rasterizer written in C++ to draw scenes composed of polygons based on an OBJ file. Includes an interactive camera that allows the user to view the object from multiple angles as well as texture mapping. Shading options include the Lambertian, Blinn Phong, and Iridescent Reflection Models. See the wahoo.obj file for the object source.
